Online Shopping System: Java/J2EE- Struts with Hibernate framework

I developed an Online shopping system software based on MVC framework and consisting of real-time payment API integration which allows users to pay for the goods they purchase. 
TECHNOLOGIES USED: Java, Struts2, Hibernate ORM, Tiles, AJAX, jQuery, Apache Lucene. By keeping in mind the security of the users, I integrated BOTDETECT Captcha into the system which stops spammers from registering on the website. To ensure further security of the customers, OTP verification was enabled using the JAVA Mail API. For real-time payment experience the Instamojo Payment API was integrated into the system allowing customers to pay online via debit/credit cards, Netbanking etc. I also enabled the Wishlist feature in the website which lets users to save products of their choice which they might buy later. The system lets users search for the exact product they want and this was achieved using Apache Lucene and Hibernate Technology.
